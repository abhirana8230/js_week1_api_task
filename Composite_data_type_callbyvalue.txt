Spread Operator is used to copy by value for composite data type. By using this method,the value of array is directly assigned to other variable so,the memory allocation for both the variable will be different. Hence, the value changed in one array will not affect the other array.

e.g. - var arr1 = [1,2,3,4,5];
       console.log(arr1)
       var arr2 = [...arr1]; // spread operator used here for copy by value of composite data type.
       arr1[0] = 6;
       var arr3 = arr1;
       console.log(arr1);
       console.log(arr2);
       console.log(arr3);

 Output - [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]
          [ 6, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]
          [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]
          [ 6, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]

The 'arr2' has the elements of 'arr1' copied into it. Due to spread operator, any changes made to 'arr1' will not affect the 'arr2'. While 'arr3' which is copied as reference will also affect 'arr1' on changes made to the values.
